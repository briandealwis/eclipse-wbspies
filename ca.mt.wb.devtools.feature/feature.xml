      This feature adds a set of development tools for the Eclipse IDE environment
to make it more useful for developers.

<ul>
<li> Stripped Java Browsing: new variant of the Java Browsing perspective
    that uses standalone views to maximize available real-estate. </li>
<li> Adds new Naviate &gt; Open Method... and Open Field... dialogs
    that does for methods and fields what Open Type does for types
    (not bound by default).</li>
<li> Allows toggling line numbers on and off (not bound by default).</li>
<li> Allows opening an editor in a new window (not bound by default).</li>
</ul>
